Dealing with the problem of buffer (memory) consumption between threads.

The sleep and wake program deals with this problem using a producer and a consumer.
The consumer consume memory from the buffer, freeing it, and the producer fills the buffer.

When the producer cannot produce more items, it sleeps and when the consumer free the buffer it 
wakeup the producer and them sleep, and when the producer started inserting more items,
 it wake up the consumer
